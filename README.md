**A clone repository for the Streamlit deployment of a deep learning model capable of distinguishing car classes, Sedan and SUV.**

Containing the notebook best saved YOLOv11 training run, the Python source file for its Streamlit deployment, and text files for additional dependencies and requirements, these files serve as the web application's foundation for the detection and classification function of the app. This project outlines the process of training YOLOv11 Nano, applied on the custom dataset with classes Sedan and SUV, integrated with the use of Roboflow for image labeling and annotations.
